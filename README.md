# mern-create

`mern-create` is a command-line tool to quickly generate MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) projects with a ready-to-use basic structure.

---

## Simple Use
The simple use is to just go to `/mern` and run `./mern.sh <project_name>` to create a project.

---

## Installation

You can install `mern-create` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install mern-create
```

> **Note:** It’s recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) or `pipx` to install Python CLI tools, avoiding conflicts with the system Python.

---

## Usage

After installation, you can create a new MERN project with:

```bash
mern-create my-project
```

This will generate the initial project structure inside the `my-project` folder.

---

```
